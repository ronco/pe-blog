Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. You are the last hope of the universe.</p>
<p>You don't know how to do any of those. It's toe-tappingly tragic! What are their names? Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Bender, we're trying our best.</p>
<p>Belligerent and numerous. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.</p>
<p>Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? You don't know how to do any of those. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? &hellip;To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? &hellip;To shreds, you say. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.</p>
<p>I'll get my kit! And until then, I can never die? The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</p>
<p>Yeah, lots of people did. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. It's a T. It goes "tuh". It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p>
<p>I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Is that a cooking show? A true inspiration for the children.</p>
<p>Ooh, name it after me! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. I never loved you. Bite my shiny metal ass. As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.</p>
<p>Oh, I don't have time for this.  I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Why did you bring us here? Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. And when we woke up, we had these bodies.</p>
<p>Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. Soothe us with sweet lies. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Why not indeed!</p>
<p>Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Is the Space Pope reptilian!? We're also Santa Claus! WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.</p>
<p>Noooooo! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Moving along&hellip; Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!</p>
<p>Why would a robot need to drink? And until then, I can never die? There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!</p>
<p>I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Kif might! I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Bender?! You stole the atom.</p>`,
